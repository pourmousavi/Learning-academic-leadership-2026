## TIPS FOR CONSISTENT LOGGING

1. **Do it immediately:** Log right after your 30-min session while fresh
2. **Be honest:** This is for you, not anyone else
3. **Be specific:** "Had better 1-on-1 with Sarah" not just "good conversation"
4. **Note patterns:** Look for recurring themes weekly/monthly
5. **Celebrate wins:** Even small ones matter
6. **Track energy:** This reveals which activities drain/energize you
7. **Use it to adjust:** If something isn't working, change it
