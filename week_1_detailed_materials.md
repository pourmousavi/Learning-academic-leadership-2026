## DAY 2 (Friday, Jan 17) - Begin Time Audit

### Today's Session (30 minutes)

**Part 1: Understanding Time Audits (10 minutes)**

**Read this:**

Most academics have no idea where their time actually goes. They feel busy but aren't sure why they're not making progress on research. A time audit reveals the truth.

**Why This Matters:**
- Research shows academics spend only 10-25% of time on actual research
- The rest: meetings, admin, email, teaching prep, interruptions
- You can't manage what you don't measure

**Your 7-Day Time Audit (Starting Today):**

You'll track every 30-minute block for the next 7 days. Yes, it's tedious. Yes, it's worth it.

**Categories to Track:**
1. **Research** (reading, writing, analysis, thinking)
2. **Teaching** (lectures, prep, grading)
3. **Meetings** (all kinds)
4. **Email & Communication**
5. **Admin** (forms, reports, bureaucracy)
6. **Student/Team Management** (1-on-1s, mentoring, supervision)
7. **Strategic Work** (planning, grant writing, networking)
8. **Reactive/Interruptions** (unexpected demands)
9. **Break/Personal**

**How to Track:**
- Set 30-min timer on your phone
- When it goes off, note what you just did
- Also note: Your energy level (High/Medium/Low)
- Special note: When you felt "in flow" vs. drained

**Part 3: Read - "Where Your Time Actually Goes" (10 minutes)**

**Key Research Findings:**

**Study 1: Analysis of 100 Senior Academics**
- Average research time: 11 hours/week (22% of 50-hour week)
- Meeting time: 18 hours/week (36%)
- Email: 8 hours/week (16%)
- Admin: 7 hours/week (14%)
- Other: 6 hours/week (12%)

**The Problem:**
Those who are most successful spend 50-60% of time on research and strategic work. How?

**Study 2: "Maker's Schedule vs. Manager's Schedule" (Paul Graham)**
- Makers (researchers, writers) need long, uninterrupted blocks
- Managers can work in 30-min chunks
- Academics try to do both and fail at both

**Key Insight:**
A 3-hour research block produces more than six 30-minute research blocks interrupted by meetings.

**Study 3: Energy Management Matters More Than Time Management**
- Peak cognitive performance varies by person
- Most academics are most creative 8am-12pm
- Yet they schedule meetings during peak times
- Result: Research gets relegated to tired hours

**What Top Performers Do Differently:**
1. **Protect sacred research time** (treat it like teaching - non-negotiable)
2. **Batch similar tasks** (all meetings on certain days)
3. **Limit email to 2-3 times/day** (not constantly)
4. **Say no to most things** (ruthlessly prioritize)
5. **Delegate everything delegable** (we'll cover this in April)

---

**Part 4: Reflection (5 minutes)**

Before seeing your data, answer these:

**Where do you THINK your time goes?**
Research: ___% | Teaching: ___% | Meetings: ___% | Admin: ___% | Other: ___%

**When are you most creative/focused?**
_______________________________________________

**What activities drain your energy most?**
_______________________________________________

**If you had 5 extra hours/week, what would you do with them?**

**Part 2: Read - "Leveraging Introversion in Academia" (10 minutes)**

**The Introversion Advantage:**

First, let's be clear: **Introversion is NOT shyness.** 
- Shyness = fear of social judgment
- Introversion = energy drain from social interaction

Many highly successful academics are introverted. Here's why it can be an advantage:

**1. Deep Work Capacity**
- Introverts excel at sustained, focused work
- Research requires deep thinking - introvert strength
- While extroverts need stimulation, introverts thrive in quiet analysis

**2. Quality Over Quantity in Relationships**
- Extroverts have many shallow connections
- Introverts build fewer, deeper relationships
- In academia, deep relationships matter more for collaboration

**3. Thoughtful Communication**
- Introverts process internally before speaking
- Results in more considered, precise communication
- Excellent for grant writing, papers, important emails

**4. Strong Listening Skills**
- Introverts naturally listen more than they talk
- Students and team members feel heard
- You pick up on things others miss

**5. One-on-One Excellence**
- Introverts shine in 1-on-1 conversations
- Perfect for mentoring students
- Better for building strategic relationships than networking events

**The Challenges (And Solutions):**

**Challenge 1: Networking events drain you**
Solution: Focus on strategic 1-on-1 coffee meetings instead. Quality > quantity.

**Challenge 2: Speaking up in large meetings**
Solution: Prepare contributions in advance. Send follow-up emails with thoughts.

**Challenge 3: Self-promotion feels uncomfortable**
Solution: Reframe as "sharing valuable work" not "bragging." Let work speak.

**Challenge 4: Leading team meetings**
Solution: Use structured agendas. Call on people directly. Mix with async communication.

**Challenge 5: Recovery time needed after social interaction**
Solution: Schedule buffer time after meetings. Protect solo time daily.

**Famous Introverted Leaders:**
- Bill Gates (Microsoft)
- Warren Buffett (Investor)
- Barack Obama (President)
- Rosa Parks (Activist)
- Eleanor Roosevelt (First Lady)
- Many Nobel Prize winners

**Key Insight:** You don't need to become extroverted. You need to work WITH your introversion, not against it.

**Part 3: Reflection Exercise (5 minutes)**

**How has your introversion been an ASSET in your career so far?**

Example: "My introversion helps me focus for long periods on complex problems"

1. _______________________________________________
2. _______________________________________________
3. _______________________________________________

**Where has it been a CHALLENGE?**

Example: "I avoid networking events, missing collaboration opportunities"

## DAY 5 (Monday, Jan 20) - What Top Researchers Do Differently

### Today's Session (30 minutes)

**Part 1: Read Research Summary (15 minutes)**

**Study: "Success Factors Among Senior Academics"**

Researchers analyzed 200 highly successful academics (defined as: consistent major grants, high citation impact, successful PhD students, leadership roles). What differentiated them?

**Surprising Finding: Technical skills were assumed.**

By the time you're a senior lecturer, everyone has technical competence. The differentiators were entirely soft skills.

**The 7 Success Factors:**

**1. Strategic Relationship Building (80% impact)**
- Not networking for networking's sake
- Identifying 10-15 key relationships and nurturing them
- Mix of: peers (collaboration), seniors (mentors), juniors (future leaders), industry (commercialization), funders (grants)
- Regular, authentic contact (not just when needing something)

**How they do it:**
- Monthly "relationship maintenance" time blocked
- Personalized notes, not mass emails
- Sharing others' work, not just own
- Introducing people to each other

**2. Ruthless Prioritization (75% impact)**
- Default answer to requests: "No"
- Three criteria: Advance research? Develop people? Build strategic relationship?
- If not clearly yes to one, decline
- Average successful academic says no to 80% of opportunities

**How they do it:**
- Annual goal-setting: 3 major goals only
- Monthly: decline at least 5 things
- Weekly: review commitments against goals
- They're comfortable being "selectively unhelpful"

**3. Delegation & Team Development (70% impact)**
- Successful academics delegate 60-70% of tasks
- Less successful: try to do everything themselves
- Key insight: "If someone else can do it 70% as well as you, delegate it"
- Frees time for strategic work only they can do

**How they do it:**
- Start with smallest viable delegation
- Invest time upfront teaching
- Accept imperfection
- Celebrate others' successes

**4. Structured Communication Systems (65% impact)**
- Don't let communication control them
- Email: 2-3 scheduled times/day
- Meetings: Theme days or specific blocks
- Drop-ins: Office hours only
- Projects: Async updates (Slack/shared docs) > meetings

**How they do it:**
- Communicate their response times clearly
- Train team to use right channel (urgent vs. not)
- Batch similar communications
- Use templates for common responses

**5. Student Development Systems (60% impact)**
- Don't wing supervision
- Structured onboarding for new students
- Regular check-ins with clear agenda
- Developmental feedback, not just technical
- Track student progress systematically

**How they do it:**
- Standard first-year curriculum for PhD students
- Monthly 1-on-1s with all students
- Feedback frameworks (not ad-hoc)
- Connect students with broader network
- Celebrate milestones

**6. Energy Management (60% impact)**
- Protect peak cognitive hours for research
- Schedule social activities when energy is lower
- Build in recovery time (introverts need more)
- Recognize when they're unproductive and stop

**How they do it:**
- Research time: morning (for most)
- Meetings: afternoon
- Admin: end of day
- One "deep work day" per week (no meetings)
- Regular exercise, sleep, breaks

**7. Proactive Over Reactive (55% impact)**
- Spend 70% of time on proactive work (research, strategic planning, relationship building, team development)
- Limit reactive work (email, requests, problems) to 30%
- Average academic: opposite ratio (70% reactive)

**How they do it:**
- Block proactive time first
- Limit "open door" time
- Create systems that reduce reactive needs
- Teach team to problem-solve without them

---

**What They DON'T Do:**

❌ Attend every meeting invited to
❌ Respond to every email within 24 hours
❌ Write papers alone
❌ Take on every student who applies
❌ Serve on every committee
❌ Work 80-hour weeks
❌ Sacrifice personal life for work
❌ Try to be good at everything

**What They DO:**

✓ Protect research time fiercely
✓ Build and leverage strong relationships
✓ Develop others systematically
✓ Say no to most things
✓ Delegate everything delegable
✓ Work in their zone of genius
✓ Maintain work-life integration
✓ Focus on high-impact activities
